This repository contains my implementation of the algorithms from "Malliavin-based Multilevel Monte Carlo Estimators for Densities of Max-stable Processes" by Zhipeng Liu and Jose Blanchet. Namely, I've implemented the algorithms necessary to simulate sample paths of a max-stable random field as well as the algorithms to estimate the multivariate density of the random field. 

This project was done as part of Stanford's MS&E research program of Summer 2021. I worked with Professor Jose Blanchet as a research intern.
